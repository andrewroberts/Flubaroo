Flubaroo
========

Local development copy of [Flubaroo](flubaroo.com), a Google Apps Script (JavaScript) for grading quizzes submitted via a Google Form. The master copy is kept under svn at [Google Code](bit.ly/FlubarooCodeGoogle), fork from there, this is purely for reference and my personal use.

It presently contains version 3.02.ag_7, a fork from v3.02 of the Flubaroo code so all features added since then aren't possibly working yet.

See flubaroo.com for full details of getting your own copy of Flubaroo
